# allowance_tracker

Overview
The Allowance Tracker application lets you add children to the app for tracking allowance. Once a child is added, you may add transactions to each child.

TODO: Ultimately the transaction recyclerview will be overhauled to more properly reflect currency transactions and sorting; however, for now each transaction is individual and not sortable. Also, field validation is minimal at this time.

NOTE: The hardware item utilized as suggested was Notifications. This doesn't require permissions, and I do not have other natural items to include that would trigger permission requesting.
